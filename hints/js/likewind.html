        You can rotate an array 90 degrees in a clockwise direction and analyze each string by the number of '#' in it. The index of the string with the minimum number of '#' will be the answer.

        How do I find the index of a string in the list?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
You could create 2 variables - max and index and set the start values to 0. After that you should compare each element of the second list (list with the amount of the '#' in each string) with the var max. Each time the element > max, you should set this value to the max and the index of this element to the var index. After loop will end, the value of the var index will be the right answer.
